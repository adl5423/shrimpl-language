# GitHub Linguist configuration
# -----------------------------
# Tell GitHub that all `.shr` files are written in the "Shrimpl" language.
# This affects language stats and, if Linguist knows about Shrimpl, highlighting.
# If Shrimpl is not yet defined in Linguist's languages.yml, GitHub will still
# group these files under the custom language name "Shrimpl" in the repo stats.

*.shr linguist-language=Shrimpl

# Optional: if you have Shrimpl examples or teaching materials in a specific
# folder and want to be explicit, you can also add patterns like:
#
# examples/**/*.shr linguist-language=Shrimpl
# tutorials/**/*.shr linguist-language=Shrimpl
