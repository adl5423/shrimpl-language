Copyright (c) 2025 Aisen D. Lopez-Ramos

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy
of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to
use, copy, modify, merge, publish, and distribute the Software, and to
permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the
following conditions:

1. Definitions

   1.1. "Shrimpl" means the Shrimpl programming language, including its
        language specification, standard libraries, reference
        implementations (such as interpreters, compilers, and tools), and
        any accompanying documentation contained in this repository.

   1.2. "Derivative Work" means any work based upon Shrimpl or the Software
        (such as a modification, enhancement, translation, or other change)
        in source or object form.

   1.3. "Product" means any application, game, service, device, or other
        work that uses Shrimpl or the Software internally or as a
        component, but which has its own distinct functionality and value
        beyond being Shrimpl itself.

2. Grant of Rights

   Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, you are hereby
   granted a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the
   duration of copyright) license to:

   2.1. Use, copy, modify, and merge the Software and any Derivative Works.

   2.2. Publish and distribute the Software and any Derivative Works, in
        source or object form.

   2.3. Use the Software and any Derivative Works to develop, build, run,
        test, and operate Products.

3. Non-Commercial Restriction on Shrimpl Itself

   3.1. You may not sell Shrimpl itself as a standalone product. This means
        you may not charge a fee (including license fees, subscription
        fees, or similar) solely for:

        (a) granting access to Shrimpl, the Software, or a Derivative Work
            whose primary purpose is to provide Shrimpl as a language
            implementation; or

        (b) distributing copies of Shrimpl, the Software, or such
            Derivative Works where Shrimpl is the main thing being sold.

   3.2. You may, however, use Shrimpl and the Software in or with Products
        and you may sell, license, or otherwise commercially exploit such
        Products, provided that:

        (a) the primary value of the Product is not merely providing access
            to Shrimpl itself; and

        (b) your customers are not being charged solely for receiving
            Shrimpl or the Software.

   3.3. Example (allowed): A commercial SaaS platform, game, or tool that
        internally uses Shrimpl for scripting or configuration, and which
        sells access to the platform, game, or tool.

        Example (not allowed): Selling a copy of Shrimpl or a repackaged
        Shrimpl distribution as a paid “Shrimpl Pro” download whose primary
        purpose is simply to be a Shrimpl implementation.

4. Contributions

   4.1. By submitting any contribution (including code, documentation,
        examples, or other material) to this project, you agree that:

        (a) you have the necessary rights to submit the contribution; and

        (b) you irrevocably license your contribution under the terms of
            this Shrimpl Language License (SLL-1.0), so that it can be
            used, modified, and distributed together with the rest of
            Shrimpl.

   4.2. The maintainers may reformat, refactor, or otherwise modify
        contributions as needed for technical, stylistic, or organizational
        reasons, while keeping them under this same License.

5. Attribution and Notice

   5.1. The above copyright notice and this License shall be included in
        all copies or substantial portions of the Software and any
        Derivative Works that are publicly distributed.

   5.2. If you distribute a Product that exposes Shrimpl to end users (for
        example, by allowing users to write Shrimpl code inside the
        Product), you must include a notice in your documentation or “About”
        section substantially as follows:

        “This product uses the Shrimpl programming language.
         Shrimpl © 2025 Aisen D. Lopez-Ramos.”

6. Trademarks

   6.1. This License does not grant permission to use the names “Shrimpl”,
        “Shrimpl Language”, the Shrimpl logo, or any related project names
        or marks as trademarks or service marks.

   6.2. You may refer to Shrimpl factually (e.g., “built with Shrimpl”) but
        must not imply sponsorship, endorsement, or official status by
        Aisen D. Lopez-Ramos or the Shrimpl project unless you have a
        separate written agreement granting such rights.
