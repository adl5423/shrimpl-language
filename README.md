# Shrimpl 0.5 Programming Language

![Shrimpl logo](/assets/shrimpl-banner.png)

## Introduction

Shrimpl is a small, beginner‑friendly programming language designed to bridge the gap between visual languages (like Scratch) and general‑purpose languages (like Python or JavaScript). It aims to be:

* **Readable**: English‑like keywords, minimal punctuation, and indentation instead of braces.
* **Approachable**: Designed so kids and new programmers can learn concepts gradually.
* **Practical**: Powerful enough to build web APIs, perform data analysis, and run simple machine‑learning workflows.

Shrimpl programs are interpreted by a Rust‑based runtime that can run on most platforms. A companion Language Server (LSP) and browser‑based API Studio make it easy to experiment, debug, and explore programs interactively.

---

## Goals

### Accessibility

* Use **plain words** and **minimal punctuation**.
* Rely on **indentation** to express structure instead of braces.
* Favor **clear error messages** and **friendly diagnostics**.
* Follow documentation guidelines inspired by writethedocs.org: short sentences, clear examples, and progressive disclosure of complexity.

### Ease of Use

* Provide **first‑class constructs** for building HTTP servers and endpoints.
* Avoid heavy frameworks or configuration files.
* Make the default experience “type code, run, see results.”

### Expressiveness

Shrimpl supports:

* Variables and expressions
* Functions and classes (with static methods)
* Built‑in helpers for text, numbers, vectors/tensors, dataframes, and linear regression
* HTTP client utilities for calling external APIs

### Safety

* Runtime checks catch errors whenever possible and report **clear messages**.
* Static analysis warns about:

  * unused path parameters
  * unused function/method parameters
  * duplicate endpoints with the same method and path

These diagnostics are visible both in the terminal and inside editor integrations via the LSP.

---

## Getting Started

### Installing the Shrimpl Interpreter

1. **Install Rust** (if you do not already have it):

   * Visit the Rust website and install via `rustup`.

2. **Install Shrimpl using Cargo**:

   ```bash
   cargo install shrimpl
   ```

   Alternatively, you can build the interpreter from source in this repository using:

   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```

   The resulting binary will be in `target/release/shrimpl`.

3. **Replit deployments**:

   * Ensure the Rust toolchain is available in `replit.nix`.
   * Add any necessary Rust dependencies.
   * Configure `.replit` to run the Shrimpl server (for example using `cargo run --bin shrimpl` or the provided run command).

### Creating Your First Program

1. In your project directory, create a file named **`app.shr`**. Shrimpl scripts always use the `.shr` extension.

2. Put this minimal program in `app.shr`:

   ```shrimpl
   server 3000

   endpoint GET "/": "Hello, Shrimpl!"
   ```

3. Run the program:

   ```bash
   shrimpl --file app.shr run
   ```

   This will:

   * Parse `app.shr`.
   * Perform basic checks.
   * Start a web server on port `3000`.

4. Open a browser and navigate to:

   ```text
   http://localhost:3000/
   ```

   You should see:

   ```text
   Hello, Shrimpl!
   ```

5. To only check syntax and diagnostics (without running the server), use:

   ```bash
   shrimpl --file app.shr check
   ```

---

## Language Overview

### Indentation and Structure

Shrimpl uses **indentation** to define blocks. Each statement is on its own line; nested blocks are indented consistently (two spaces is typical). Examples:

```shrimpl
server 3000

endpoint GET "/":
  "Hello, Shrimpl!"  # body is indented
```

Mixing spaces and tabs is discouraged and may cause parsing issues. Choose one (spaces are recommended) and keep it consistent.

---

## Servers

A Shrimpl program that exposes HTTP endpoints must declare a **server**:

```shrimpl
server 3000
```

* The number is the **port** the server listens on.
* Only **one** `server` declaration is allowed per program.
* The server must appear **before** any `endpoint` declarations.

If multiple servers are declared, the interpreter will issue a warning.

---

## Endpoints

Endpoints declare HTTP routes. An endpoint has:

* An **HTTP method**: `GET` or `POST`.
* A **path**: a quoted string, optionally including path parameters like `"/hello/:name"`.
* A **body**: an indented expression that determines the response.

### Basic Example

```shrimpl
endpoint GET "/": "Hello, Shrimpl!"
```

### Path Parameters

Path segments starting with `:` become variables in the endpoint body:

```shrimpl
endpoint GET "/hello/:name":
  "Hello " + name
```

* Request: `GET /hello/Aisen`
* The variable `name` becomes `"Aisen"`.
* Response: `"Hello Aisen"`.

### Query Parameters

Query parameters are also exposed as variables:

```shrimpl
endpoint GET "/greet":
  "Hello " + name
```

* Request: `/greet?name=Aisen`
* The variable `name` is set to `"Aisen"`.

### Text vs JSON Endpoints

The endpoint body can return **text** or **JSON**:

```shrimpl
# Plain text
endpoint GET "/text": "Just a string"

# JSON
endpoint GET "/info":
  json { "name": "Shrimpl", "version": 0.5 }
```

When using `json { ... }`, the body must be a **constant** JSON object (expressions are not evaluated inside the JSON literal).

---

## Expressions

Shrimpl supports a small but expressive set of expression features:

### Literals

* Numbers: `42`, `3.14`
* Strings: `"Hello"`
* JSON objects: `json { "key": 123 }`

### Variables

Names starting with a letter or underscore. Common sources:

* Path parameters (e.g., `:id` -> `id`)
* Query parameters (e.g., `?foo=bar` -> `foo`)
* Function parameters
* Method parameters

### Operators

* Arithmetic: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` (normal precedence)
* String concatenation: `+` (if either side is a string, result is a string)

### Function and Method Calls

* Function call: `funcName(arg1, arg2)`
* Class method call: `ClassName.methodName(arg1, arg2)`

---

## Variables and Data Types

Shrimpl is **dynamically typed**. Values can be:

* Numbers
* Strings
* JSON arrays/objects

### Core Built‑ins

These functions convert between data types or operate on them:

| Built‑in       | Description                                       |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `number(x)`    | Convert string or number `x` to a floating‑point. |
| `string(x)`    | Convert any value to a string.                    |
| `len(x)`       | Length of a string.                               |
| `upper(x)`     | Convert a string to uppercase.                    |
| `lower(x)`     | Convert a string to lowercase.                    |
| `sum(a,b,...)` | Sum of numbers.                                   |
| `avg(a,b,...)` | Average of numbers.                               |
| `min(a,b,...)` | Minimum of numbers.                               |
| `max(a,b,...)` | Maximum of numbers.                               |

---

## Functions

Define reusable calculations with the `func` keyword:

```shrimpl
func greet(name):
  "Hello " + name
```

Rules:

* Syntax: `func name(param1, param2, ...): <expression>`
* The body is a **single expression** whose value is returned.
* Parameters are local variables inside the function body.
* Unused parameters trigger a **warning** from the static analyzer.

Example usage inside an endpoint:

```shrimpl
endpoint GET "/welcome/:name":
  greet(name) + "!"
```

---

## Classes

Shrimpl supports simple **classes with static methods**. Use them to group related functionality:

```shrimpl
class Math:
  double(x): x * 2
  square(x): x * x
```

* Syntax: `class Name:` followed by indented method definitions.
* Methods: `methodName(params): expression`.
* Methods do not have access to `self` or instance data; they are purely static.

Usage:

```shrimpl
endpoint GET "/double/:n":
  Math.double(number(n))
```

---

## Built‑In Libraries

### HTTP Client

Use these to call external APIs:

| Function             | Description                                                               |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `http_get(url)`      | Send HTTP GET request to `url`, return **raw body** as a string.          |
| `http_get_json(url)` | GET `url`, parse response as JSON, and return pretty‑printed JSON string. |

Example:

```shrimpl
endpoint GET "/pokemon/:id":
  http_get_json("https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/" + id)
```

### Vector and Tensor Operations

The runtime includes helpers for numeric arrays:

| Function           | Description                                                                  |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `vec(a, b, ...)`   | Create a JSON array `[a, b, ...]`. Numeric strings are converted to numbers. |
| `tensor_add(a, b)` | Elementwise add two JSON arrays of equal length; returns a JSON array.       |
| `tensor_dot(a, b)` | Dot product of two JSON arrays of equal length; returns a number.            |

Example:

```shrimpl
endpoint GET "/dot":
  tensor_dot(
    vec(number(ax), number(ay)),
    vec(number(bx), number(by))
  )
```

### DataFrames (Pandas‑like)

Dataframes are represented as JSON objects:

```json
{
  "columns": ["name", "age"],
  "rows": [["Alice", 30], ["Bob", 25]]
}
```

| Function                   | Description                                                               |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `df_from_csv(url)`         | Download CSV from `url` and return dataframe JSON. Numbers become floats. |
| `df_head(df_json, n)`      | Return first `n` rows of the dataframe.                                   |
| `df_select(df_json, cols)` | Return new dataframe with only specified columns (`"col1,col2"`).         |

Examples:

```shrimpl
endpoint GET "/load":
  df_from_csv("https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/csv/hw_200.csv")

endpoint GET "/head":
  df_head(df, 5)
```

### Machine Learning (Linear Regression)

Shrimpl 0.5 includes basic linear regression support. Models are JSON objects:

```json
{ "kind": "linreg", "a": 2.0, "b": 0.0 }
```

| Function                        | Description                                                     |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `linreg_fit(xs_json, ys_json)`  | Train regression model from arrays `xs` and `ys` (JSON arrays). |
| `linreg_predict(model_json, x)` | Predict `y` from model and input `x`; returns a number.         |

Examples:

```shrimpl
endpoint GET "/train":
  linreg_fit(xs, ys)

endpoint GET "/predict":
  linreg_predict(model, number(x))
```

---

## JSON Responses

To return JSON, prefix the body with `json` and provide a constant JSON object:

```shrimpl
endpoint GET "/info":
  json { "name": "Shrimpl", "version": 0.5 }
```

* The interpreter does **not** evaluate expressions inside `json { ... }`.
* Use this style for configuration‑like responses or metadata.

---

## Diagnostics and Warnings

Shrimpl performs static analysis to help keep programs clean and predictable. The diagnostics engine currently checks for:

* **Unused path parameters**: `endpoint GET "/:id"` where `id` never appears in the body.
* **Unused function parameters**: `func foo(x, y)` where `y` is never used.
* **Unused method parameters** in classes.
* **Duplicate endpoints**: same HTTP method and path appearing more than once.

Diagnostics appear in several places:

1. **Command line** via `shrimpl --file app.shr check`.
2. **API Studio** (browser UI) under the “Diagnostics” panel.
3. **Editors** that use the Shrimpl LSP (listed below), using standard LSP diagnostics.

---

## Shrimpl API Studio (Web UI)

When a Shrimpl server is running, you can open the interactive API Studio:

```text
http://localhost:<port>/__shrimpl/ui
```

The UI provides:

* **Endpoint Explorer**

  * Lists all endpoints with method, path, and body type.
* **Request Panel**

  * Fill in path parameters and query strings.
  * Send requests and inspect responses without leaving the browser.
* **Response Panel**

  * Shows status code, timestamp, and body.
  * Pretty‑prints JSON responses.
* **Source Panel**

  * Displays `app.shr` with syntax highlighting.
  * Highlighting mirrors the editor grammars (keywords, methods, strings, numbers, comments).
* **Diagnostics Panel**

  * Lists warnings and (future) errors.
  * Each item includes a `kind`, `scope` (endpoint/function/method), and a human‑readable message.

This UI is designed for learners who benefit from immediate feedback: change code, refresh the page, and see how behavior and diagnostics change.

---

## Language Server Protocol (LSP) Support

Shrimpl ships with a dedicated Language Server, **`shrimpl-lsp`**, which provides IDE‑style features for `.shr` files.

### Capabilities

The Shrimpl LSP currently implements:

* **Live diagnostics**

  * Parses the open document and reports syntax errors.
  * Runs the same static checks as the Shrimpl docs module (unused parameters, duplicate endpoints, etc.).
* **Hover information**

  * Hover over `server`, `endpoint`, function names, class names, or methods to see a short description.
* **Completions**

  * Keyword stubs such as `server`, `endpoint`, `func`, `class`, `GET`, `POST`.
  * Can be extended with snippets and common patterns.
* **Document symbols (outline)**

  * Exposes servers, endpoints, functions, and classes as `DocumentSymbol`s.
  * Lets editors show an outline/tree view for `.shr` files.

### Running the LSP Server

Build and run the LSP binary from this repo:

```bash
cargo build --bin shrimpl-lsp

# or run directly
cargo run --bin shrimpl-lsp
```

The LSP speaks JSON‑RPC 2.0 over stdio (the standard model used by most editors).

### Editor Integrations

In the repository, the `editors/` folder contains sample configurations:

* **VS Code** (`editors/vscode/`)

  * `package.json`: VS Code extension manifest (language id, activation events, LSP wiring).
  * `extension.ts`: connects VS Code to the `shrimpl-lsp` binary and registers the language.
  * `syntaxes/shrimpl.tmLanguage.json`: TextMate grammar mirroring the API Studio highlighting.
  * `language-configuration.json`: comment syntax (`#`), bracket pairs, word patterns, etc.
  * To use locally:

    1. Open `editors/vscode` in VS Code.
    2. Run `npm install`.
    3. Use `F5` to start an “Extension Development Host” and open a folder with `.shr` files.

* **Neovim** (`editors/nvim-shrimpl/shrimpl.lua`)

  * Lua configuration that registers `shrimpl-lsp` with `nvim-lspconfig`.
  * You can copy or adapt the config into your own Neovim setup.

* **Sublime Text** (`editors/sublime/`)

  * Example `LSP-shrimpl.sublime-settings` for the Sublime LSP plugin.
  * Settings point the plugin at the `shrimpl-lsp` binary and restrict it to `*.shr` files.

* **JetBrains** (`editors/jetbrains/shrimpl-lsp.json`)

  * Sample configuration for JetBrains IDEs with LSP support, mapping `.shr` to the Shrimpl language server.

These examples are intended as starting points; you can customize paths, commands, and additional capabilities as needed.

---

## Best Practices

* **Use meaningful names**

  * Name functions, classes, and parameters descriptively to reduce the need for comments.

* **Keep functions small**

  * Each `func` or method should evaluate a single expression.
  * Break complex logic into smaller helper functions.

* **Validate external input**

  * When calling external APIs with `http_get`/`df_from_csv`, ensure the response format matches what your code expects.

* **Handle errors gracefully**

  * Consider returning error strings or JSON objects when user input is missing or invalid.

* **Comment intention, not mechanics**

  * Use `#` comments to explain *why* something exists, especially in tutorial code.

* **Stay consistent**

  * Indent with two spaces.
  * Stick to one naming convention for endpoints and parameters.

---

## Implementation Notes (High‑Level)

Shrimpl’s implementation (in this repository) is roughly organized as follows:

* **Parser (`src/parser/`)**

  * Tokenizes and parses `.shr` source into an abstract syntax tree (AST).
  * The AST types live in `parser/ast.rs`.

* **AST / Core Model (`src/ast.rs`, `src/parser/ast.rs`)**

  * Defines core entities such as `Program`, `Endpoint`, `FunctionDef`, `ClassDef`, and `Expr`.

* **Interpreter (`src/interpreter/`)**

  * Evaluates Shrimpl expressions.
  * Implements HTTP server wiring and endpoint dispatch.
  * Integrates built‑in libraries (HTTP client, vectors, tensors, dataframes, linear regression).

* **Docs and Diagnostics (`src/docs.rs`)**

  * Builds a JSON schema for the API Studio (`/__shrimpl/schema`).
  * Computes static diagnostics (unused params, duplicate endpoints, etc.).

* **CLI / Entry Point (`src/main.rs`)**

  * Parses command‑line flags such as `--file`, `run`, `check`, `diagnostics`.
  * Invokes the interpreter or diagnostics mode accordingly.

* **Language Server (`src/bin/shrimpl_lsp.rs`)**

  * Implements the LSP server using `tower-lsp`.
  * Reuses the parser and docs diagnostics to provide:

    * `textDocument/publishDiagnostics`
    * `textDocument/hover`
    * `textDocument/completion`
    * `textDocument/documentSymbol`

* **API Studio UI (`src/docs.rs` embedded HTML)**

  * Serves the `__shrimpl/ui` page.
  * Fetches schema, diagnostics, and source from HTTP endpoints exposed by the interpreter.
  * Renders interactive panels in the browser using vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.

This architecture keeps the **language core** (parser + interpreter + docs) separate from **presentation layers** (CLI, LSP, API Studio, editor plugins).

---

## Conclusion

Shrimpl 0.5 combines the simplicity of visual programming with the power of modern languages. It offers a gentle introduction to:

* Server‑side programming and HTTP APIs
* Data manipulation using dataframes and vectors
* Basic machine learning with linear regression

The interpreter, diagnostics engine, API Studio, and LSP work together to create a friendly learning environment. Learners can:

1. Write simple `.shr` files.
2. See immediate results in the browser.
3. Get real‑time feedback from their editor.
4. Grow into more advanced topics (dataframes, ML, external APIs) without leaving Shrimpl.
